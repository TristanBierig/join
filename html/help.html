    <p class="help-text">Join is a project management tool that provides an overview of tasks, their priorities and the responsibilities for the tasks. It uses Kanban as a method from agile project management. The goal is to ideally distribute the work to be done and the available capacities. The most important element of this method is the Kanban Board. This is divided into different work phases.
      <br><br>Additionally, Join offers the possibility to add new contacts under the Contacts tab.
